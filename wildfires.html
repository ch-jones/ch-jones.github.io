                <p>During the <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/2681249/fort-mcmurray-wildfire-timeline-of-events/">2016 Fort McMurray wildfire</a>, my extended family was uprooted, and we waited in distress to hear that they evacuated their homes safely. After knowing they were safe, we waited again, wondering if their homes and livelihoods would still be there to return to. Thankfully, my family and their homes were safe, but many were not.</p>
                <p>Because of this situation, I became more aware of wildfires and how climate change has increased the amount and severity of them. I chose to focus my project on educating people on the direct impact climate change has on wildfires, and the forecasted effects wildfires will have on humans.</p>

                <h2><i class="fi-clipboard-notes"></i>Research</h2>
                <p>At the outset, secondary research was conducted on news articles about wildfires internationally. This was then concentrated and focused on Canada, using the <a href="http://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/ha/nfdb" target="_blank">Canadian Wildland Fire Information System</a>. This focused on data about Canadian wildfires in the past 20 years. The main points from this research were that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wildfires are a natural part of forest ecosystem</li>
                    <li>Wildfires are relatively harmless to the earth when CO2 levels are normal and the environment is healthy.</li>
                    <li>Increases in CO2 levels cause wildfires to be larger, more frequent, and more dangerous</li>
                    <li>Wildfires are therefore harder to control, leading to unnatural environmental damage</li>
                    <li>They are spreading into residential areas, impacting habitats and ecosystems.</li>
                    <li>High CO2 levels cause hotter temperatures and drier environmental conditions globally.</li>
                    <li>This has started causing wildfires in ecosystems where they have never before been observed in human history, like the Arctic Tundra.</li>
                    <li>Wildfires will likely cause many habitats and residential areas to be uninhabitable</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>Flowchart</h3>
                    <p>Before creating wireframes, the research was applied in a flowchart to map out how the interface would work, and what specific text would appear to the user. This informed the site's functionality.</p>

                <p>To animate and integrate the elements in the web, I created 3D collada models of a low poly tree, house, and tundra mountain in Cinema4D. This allowed the collada models to be imported and manipulated using three.js and JavaScript.</p>
                <p>Additionally, a transparent fire image was created in Photoshop to apply to a particle cloud, giving the site the effect of animated fire.</p>
